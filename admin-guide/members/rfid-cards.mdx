## Tips & Best Practices

- **Unique Numbers**: Ensure all card numbers are unique within your organization
- **Regular Audits**: Periodically review card assignments and status
- **Expiry Dates**: Set expiry dates for temporary cards
- **Status Updates**: Keep card status current (lost, stolen, etc.)
- **Notes**: Use notes to track card history and special circumstances
- **Primary Cards**: Ensure each member has one primary card

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Cannot assign card to member
**Solution**: Check if the card is already assigned to another member or if the member exists

**Issue**: Card number already exists
**Solution**: Use a different card number - each card must have a unique identifier

**Issue**: Cannot delete assigned card
**Solution**: Unassign the card from all members before deleting

**Issue**: Member has multiple primary cards
**Solution**: Only one card can be primary per member - assign new primary will unset others

**Issue**: Card status not updating
**Solution**: Refresh the page or check your permissions for card management
