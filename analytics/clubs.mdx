**In a nutshell:** View club-level metrics for today or over a historical period so you can monitor utilization and performance by location.

## Overview

Use the **Analytics** hub and open the **Clubs** category to access:

- **Today** — Snapshot of current-day activity and utilization for each club.
- **Historical** — Trends and comparisons over time (e.g. by week or month) for clubs.

Filter by club and date range as needed. These reports help you compare locations and plan capacity.
