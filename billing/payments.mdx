**In a nutshell:** The Payments section shows all payment records, status, and payment history so you can track what has been collected and resolve failed or pending payments.

## Overview

Use **Billing → Payments** to see payments made by members, filter by status or date, and drill into individual payment details. Payments are created when invoices are paid (e.g. via Stripe) or when you record manual payments.

## Key features

- **Payment list** — View all payments with status (succeeded, failed, pending, refunded).
- **Payment details** — Open a payment to see amount, method, invoice link, and related member.
- **Filters** — Filter by date range, status, club, or member.
- **Failed payments** — Identify and retry or update failed payments.
