**In a nutshell:** Document signatures tracks which members have signed required documents (e.g. waivers, terms) so you can see completion status and access signed copies.

## Overview

Use **Content → Document signatures** to see a list of signature records: which document was signed, by whom, and when. Signatures are collected via the member portal or signup flow when document rules require them.

## Key features

- **Signature list** — View all signature events; filter by document, member, or date.
- **Signature details** — Open a record to see signer, document version, and timestamp.
- **Compliance** — Confirm that required documents have been signed before access or membership.
