## Editing the docs locally

This documentation site is built with [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com). You can edit MDX files and preview changes locally.

<Info>
  **Prerequisites:** Node.js 19 or higher, and a clone of this docs repository with a `docs.json` file at the root.
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the Mintlify CLI">

```bash
npm i -g mint
```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Preview locally">

Navigate to the docs directory (where `docs.json` is located) and run:

```bash
mint dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` to view the site. The preview updates as you edit files.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Custom port

To use a different port (e.g. 3333):

```bash
mint dev --port 3333
```

## Checking links

To find broken links in the documentation:

```bash
mint broken-links
```

## API reference

API documentation is generated from the 1Club server OpenAPI spec. To export the spec from the server repo, run from the `server` directory:

```bash
npm run openapi:export
```

Set `OPENAPI_OUTPUT` to copy the generated `openapi.json` into this docs repo if needed. The API reference tab (if enabled) uses that spec.

## Formatting and style

- Use the [MDX VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) for syntax highlighting.
- Follow the style in **AGENTS.md** in this repo: active voice, second person, sentence case headings, bold for UI elements, code for paths and commands.
