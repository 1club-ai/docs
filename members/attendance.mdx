title: Attendance Tracking
---

In a nutshell, the attendance system lets you track when members visit your club, whether they're using existing bookings, memberships, or creating new ones on the spot.

## Overview

The attendance tracking system provides comprehensive check-in management for your club members. You can record member visits, track usage against memberships, and monitor club activity patterns. The system automatically handles membership usage tracking and prevents duplicate check-ins.

Key capabilities:

- **Manual Check-ins**: Add check-ins for members with existing bookings or memberships
- **Quick Check-ins**: Create new bookings or memberships during check-in
- **Usage Tracking**: Automatically decrement membership uses when applicable
- **Calendar View**: Visual calendar interface for selecting date ranges
- **Member Search**: Quick member lookup and selection
- **Reference Tracking**: See what booking, class, or membership was used

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Cannot find a member in the dropdown
**Solution**: Ensure the member exists in your contacts and has an active status

**Issue**: Membership shows as "no remaining uses"
**Solution**: Check if the membership has usage limits and if all uses have been consumed

**Issue**: Check-in not appearing in the list
**Solution**: Refresh the page or check the date filter - check-ins are ordered by creation date

**Issue**: Cannot delete a check-in
**Solution**: Ensure you have the proper permissions for attendance management

**Issue**: Calendar not showing correct dates
**Solution**: Clear your browser cache or try a different browser
