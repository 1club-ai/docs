## Get started with 1Club admin

This guide walks you through the first steps: sign in, complete your profile, add a club and a plan, and create your first member and booking.

## Step 1: Sign in

1. Open your organization's admin URL (e.g. **https://admin.1club.ai** or your custom domain).
2. Sign in with the credentials provided by your administrator (email and password or OAuth).
3. If you belong to multiple organizations, select the one you want to work in.

## Step 2: Complete your profile

1. Go to **Settings → Profile**.
2. Update your name and contact information.
3. Set **Settings → Notifications** if you want to adjust email or in-app notification preferences.

## Step 3: Set up your organization and club

1. Go to **Settings → Organization** and ensure your organization name and slug are correct.
2. Go to **Settings → Clubs** and add at least one club (e.g. your main location). Enter name, address, and any contact details.
3. Optionally configure **Settings → Area types** and **Settings → Instructor types** so you can define areas and assign instructors later.

## Step 4: Configure billing (optional but recommended)

1. Go to **Settings → Integrations** and connect **Stripe** so you can collect payments.
2. Go to **Billing → Plans** and create at least one membership plan (name, price, billing interval).
3. Optionally set up **Settings → Billing (general)** and **Settings → Automated billing** for bill runs and tax rates.

## Step 5: Add your first member

1. Go to **Members → Member list** and add a new member (or use the member portal signup if enabled).
2. Assign a membership plan to the member from **Members → Memberships**.
3. Optionally assign a member card under **Members → Member cards** if you use RFID or access credentials.

## Step 6: Create a booking or class

1. Go to **Operations → Areas** and ensure you have at least one area (e.g. a court or room).
2. Go to **Operations → Schedule** or **Operations → Bookings** and create a booking for the member and area.
3. Or go to **Operations → Classes** to create a class and assign an instructor; members can then book into the class.
