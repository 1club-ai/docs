description: How organizations and clubs work in 1Club's multi-tenant model
---

**In a nutshell:** All data in 1Club is scoped by **organization**. An organization can have multiple **clubs** (locations or venues). Users can belong to more than one organization; when they log in to the admin they work in the context of one organization at a time.

## Organization

- **Organization** is the top-level tenant. It has a name, slug, and settings (branding, billing, integrations, etc.).
- **Data scope:** Members, contacts, bookings, classes, areas, plans, invoices, messages, and all other entities belong to an organization. You only see and manage data for the organization you are currently using.
- **Switching organization:** If your user is in multiple organizations, you can switch the active organization in the admin (e.g. via a switcher in the header or profile). The URL or context updates so all list and detail views show that organization’s data.

## Clubs

- **Clubs** are locations or venues within an organization. For example, one organization might have "Downtown Gym" and "North Studio" as two clubs.
- **Usage:** Bookings, areas, and classes are associated with clubs. Members may have access to one or more clubs depending on their membership or plan. Reports and dashboards can be filtered by club.
- **Setup:** Create and edit clubs under **Settings → Clubs**. Each club can have its own address, contact info, and operational settings.

## Why it matters

- **Permissions and access:** Roles (admin, manager, staff, etc.) are per organization. When you invite a user, you assign them to an organization and a role; they see only that organization’s data when that org is selected.
- **Billing and branding:** Stripe Connect, branding, member portal, and marketplace listing are typically configured at the organization level so all clubs under that org share the same billing and brand.
- **Reporting:** Analytics and reports can be broken down by club so you can compare performance across locations.
