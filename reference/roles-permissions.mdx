title: Roles and permissions
description: Understand admin roles and what each role can access in 1Club
---

**In a nutshell:** 1Club uses role-based access control (RBAC). Each admin user has one role that determines which areas of the admin they can see and what they can do (view, create, update, delete, or full manage).

## Overview

Roles are assigned when a user is invited to the organization (Settings → Users) or when you edit a user. The system checks permissions per module (Members, Operations, Billing, etc.) and per action (read, create, update, delete, manage). The **member** and **user** roles have no admin access; they use the member portal or public apps.

## Roles

| Role | Typical use | Access summary |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Admin** | Owner or main administrator | Full access to all modules: members, marketing, website (content), operations, billing, analytics, settings. |
| **Manager** | Club or department manager | Can read, create, and update members and operations; full marketing (deals, pipeline); read analytics. Cannot access settings or delete members. |
| **Instructor** | Coach or teacher | Can read members and operations; update operations (e.g. their classes/bookings); read analytics. No billing, no settings, no member delete. |
| **Staff** | Receptionist or front desk | Full member and operations management; read billing and analytics. No settings access. |
| **User** | Internal user (no admin) | No admin panel access. |
| **Member** | End member | No admin panel access; uses member portal and public apps. |

## Modules and actions

- **Modules:** Members, Marketing, Website (content), Operations, Billing, Analytics, Settings.
- **Actions:** Read, Create, Update, Delete, **Manage** (full CRUD and special actions for that module), Invite, Export, Import where applicable.
- **Manage** on a module means full control (create, read, update, delete and any module-specific actions) for that area.

## Where to set roles

- **Settings → Users** — Invite or edit organization users and assign their role. Only users with settings access (e.g. admin) can change roles.
