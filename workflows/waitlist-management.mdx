**In a nutshell:** Automatically manage waitlists when classes or facilities are full, notify members when spots open up, and convert waitlist entries to confirmed bookings.

## What is Waitlist Management?

Waitlist management handles the process when your popular classes or facilities are fully booked. Instead of turning members away, you can add them to a waitlist and automatically notify them when spots become available.

## Key Features

- **Track waitlist position** and priority
- **Automatic notifications** when spots open
- **Convert to booking** when member confirms

### **Waitlist Organization**

- **Priority management** for special circumstances
- **Waitlist limits** to prevent excessive waiting
- **Expiration dates** for waitlist entries

### **Member Communication**

- **SMS alerts** for urgent availability
- **App notifications** for real-time updates
- **Confirmation deadlines** for response time

## How Waitlists Work

### **When Classes Are Full**

1. **Member tries to book** a class that's full
2. **System offers waitlist** option instead
3. **Member joins waitlist** with contact information
4. **Position assigned** based on join time
5. **Confirmation sent** with waitlist details

### **When Spots Open Up**

1. **Someone cancels** their booking
2. **System checks waitlist** for next in line
3. **Notification sent** to next member
4. **Member has limited time** to confirm
5. **Booking created** if member responds in time

### **If Member Doesn't Respond**

1. **Confirmation deadline** expires
2. **Next person** on waitlist is notified
3. **Process repeats** until someone confirms
4. **Original member** stays on waitlist if still interested
